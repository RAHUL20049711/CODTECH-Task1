## Overview of the Quiz Game Project
This project implements a simple multiple-choice quiz game in C++. It is designed to test the user’s knowledge across various topics by presenting a series of questions, collecting responses, and providing immediate feedback. At the end of the game, the user’s performance is evaluated based on their score.

### Key Features
Interactive Question-Answering:

The user answers each question by selecting from multiple-choice options.
Immediate feedback is provided after each question.
Score Tracking:

The program keeps track of the user's score throughout the game.
The score is displayed at the end, with a performance summary.
Dynamic Question Storage:

Questions, options, and correct answers are stored in a structured format using a struct and a vector, making it easy to add or modify questions.
Performance Feedback:

Based on the final score, the user receives tailored feedback such as "Excellent," "Good job," or "Better luck next time."
Components of the Project
Question Structure:

Each question is represented by a struct that holds:
Question text.
Multiple-choice options.
Index of the correct option.
Game Logic:

A loop iterates through all the questions in the quiz.
The user’s input is validated against the correct answer.
The score is updated dynamically.
User Interface:

The game displays clear instructions.
Each question and its options are shown in a user-friendly format.
Feedback Mechanism:

Correct answers are acknowledged with "Correct!" messages.
Incorrect answers display the right option to promote learning.
How It Works
The program starts by welcoming the user and providing basic instructions.
It presents questions one at a time with multiple-choice options.
The user selects an answer by typing a number corresponding to the option.
Immediate feedback is given after each question, and the score is updated.
At the end of the quiz:
The final score is displayed.
A summary message based on performance is provided.
Potential Enhancements
Randomized Questions: Shuffle the order of questions for variety.
Persistent Storage: Save scores to a file for tracking progress over time.
Timer: Limit the time to answer each question.
Difficulty Levels: Introduce questions categorized by difficulty.
Graphical Interface: Upgrade to a GUI using libraries like SFML or Qt for a visually appealing experience.
This project is beginner-friendly and offers a practical way to learn and practice fundamental C++ concepts like structs, vectors, loops, and conditionals.
