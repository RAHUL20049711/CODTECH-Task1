/* Explanation:
Question Struct:
A struct named Question is created to hold each question, its options, and the correct answer index.
Quiz Data:
The quiz is stored as a vector of Question objects.
Game Logic:
The game loops through each question, displays it, and accepts user input.
It compares the userâ€™s choice with the correct answer and updates the score accordingly.
